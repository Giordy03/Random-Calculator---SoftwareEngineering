# Random Calculator

## Personal assigment 2: individual software process

### Overview 
The program, written in Python, take from the user an input n (positive integer number). That number 
defines how many expressions the computer must generate. Each expression consists of m terms, m is a 
random number between three and five, (consequentially the number of operations will be m - 1). Also, 
the operation to be perform is randomly chosen by the program (between the four basic operations: 
addiction, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each term, once again randomly picked, can assume 
every value between zero and one hundred (extrema included). 	
Then  it creates a .txt file, `'Result.txt'`. The first line of this file should be the 
student ID of whom had write the code, the other lines should contain all the n expressions and their 
result written on n different lines. (The expression should be written in a mathematical way).

### Input example
```markdown
Please, enter a positive integer: 4
```
### Output example in the .txt file
```markdown
<STUDENT ID>
13 +17 - 1 = 29
11 * 15 - 5 = 160
3 + 10 + 4 - 16 = 1
15 / 5 - 2 = 4
```
